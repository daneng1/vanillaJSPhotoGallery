## About 

This is a photo gallery site that uses the Unsplash API to display the 60 newest images on their site. It was built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No other libraries or frameworks were used even though I would have preferred to build this in React. The challenge was to build the site with vanilla JavaScrip.
